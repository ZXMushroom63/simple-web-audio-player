# simple-web-audio-player
Quick HTML5 audio player I made because I was bored

Click on "no file selected" to open a file picker, then click "> play" to start playing it.
Console commands include loop and speed.

I made use of [Alec Lownes' CSS CRT effect](https://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html), minus flickering.
